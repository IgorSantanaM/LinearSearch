# LinearSearch

This repository contains a simple C# console application that demonstrates linear search on an array of random integers.

## Description

The `LinearSearchTest` application creates an instance of the `LinearArray` class, which initializes an array of random integers between 10 and 99. It then allows the user to input integers and performs a linear search to find if the integer exists in the array and displays its position if found.

## Requirements

To compile and run the `LinearSearchTest` application, you need:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - Ensure you have .NET SDK installed for your operating system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LinearSearchTest.git
   cd LinearSearchTest
   ```
2. Build the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
Follow the on-screen prompts:
```

Enter an integer value (-1 to quit).
The application will search for the integer in the array.
If found, it will display the position of the integer in the array.
If not found, it will indicate that the integer was not found.
